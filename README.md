# Object-Tracker-using-Correlation-Filters

It's a basic tracker based on correlation filter.

But I used only one sample to train the filter, there are still some problems needed to be fixed.

You can run the mosse.m in MATLAB to see the result.

**Don't forget to explore the PDF named [Haocheng DAI - Overview on object tracking](https://github.com/aarentai/Object-Tracker-using-Correlation-Filters/blob/master/Haocheng%20DAI%20-%20Overview%20on%20object%20tracking.compressed.pdf), in which I manifested all my understanding mainly regarding trackers using correlation filter.**
